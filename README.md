# Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a common and easily overlooked typographical error when using JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements.  The bug involves a misspelling of the `getElementById` method, which results in the intended element not being found and therefore no changes being applied. 

The `bug.html` file showcases the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

This is a simple but effective example of how small errors can lead to unexpected behavior and highlight the importance of careful coding and attention to detail.
